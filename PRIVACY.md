# Privacy Policy for reIS

**Last Updated: September 4, 2026**

## Introduction
reIS ("we", "our", or "us") is a Chrome extension designed to modernize and enhance the user experience of the Mendel University Information System (IS Mendelu). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.

## Data Collection
We collect the following information:

### 1. Academic Data (Local Only)
We fetch and store the following information directly from MENDELU services to your device:
- **Student Information**: Name, personal number (UIC), and study details.
- **Academic Data**: Schedules, grades, exam dates, success rates, and course materials.
- **Authentication Data**: Session cookies required to make authenticated requests to IS Mendelu on your behalf.

This data is stored **locally on your device** using highly efficient storage (IndexedDB) and is **never** transmitted to our servers.

There is no longer any exception to that. Library study-room booking — the one feature that ever relayed your name, university email and student ID onwards — was removed in September 2026, together with the server route that carried it.

### 2. Anonymous Usage Analytics
We collect anonymous usage data to improve the extension:
- **Interaction Data**: Clicks on notifications and views of the notification feed.
- **Purpose**: To rank relevance of student association notifications.
- **Privacy**: This data is **not linked** to your identity, IS credentials, or personal content.

### 3. Daily Usage & NPS Feedback
To understand how actively reIS is used, we record:
- **Daily Usage**: Each day you open reIS, a **random identifier generated on your device** is sent to our Supabase backend to record one usage event. This identifier is a random UUID created the first time you use the app and stored locally. It is **not derived from your student ID, your name, or anything else about you**, and it cannot be linked back to you.
- **NPS Rating (Voluntary)**: Once per semester you may be shown a satisfaction prompt. If you choose to rate, the same random identifier and your rating are sent. You can dismiss the prompt without sending anything.

**What this means for our numbers**: because the identifier belongs to an installation rather than to a person, these figures count **installations, not people**. If you use reIS on a phone and a laptop, you are counted twice.

**Previously**: until August 2026 these events were keyed on a SHA-256 hash of your student ID. We described that as irreversible. That was wrong — MENDELU student IDs are six or seven digits, so the hash can be reversed by brute force in seconds, which made it a recoverable identifier. We have replaced it in the app, and we have irreversibly re-keyed every historical row: each old hash was passed through HMAC-SHA256 under a random key that was generated for that one operation and immediately discarded. The original hashes cannot be recovered by anyone, including us. We verified this by brute-forcing the entire six- and seven-digit student-ID space against the stored values: zero matches.

### 4. Teacher Grading Feedback (Voluntary)
If you tap the grading tag on a subject's teacher, we store the tag you chose (e.g. how the subject is graded) against that **teacher's** IS id.
- **Identity**: the vote carries a **random identifier generated on your device for that one teacher** — not your student ID, and not the same identifier you send for any other teacher. Two votes by the same person cannot be linked to each other.
- **Why per-teacher**: a single device-wide id would have let the set of teachers you voted on reconstruct your course load, which is academic data. Scoping it to one teacher removes that.
- **What it is for**: showing other students how a subject is graded. Nothing about you is displayed.

### 5. User Feedback (Voluntary)
If you use the built-in "Report Bug / Feedback" feature, the following data is sent to our support channel:
- **Content**: The subject/title, the category you select (bug, idea, or other), the message, and contact details you explicitly provide.
- **Technical Context**: Extension version, browser name and version, viewport size, and the current in-app screen (e.g. `calendar`, `exams`, `settings` — an app view name, not a URL or page address) to help debug issues.
- **Storage**: Suggestions are stored in reIS's own Supabase project. Read access is restricted by a database policy to signed-in accounts holding the `reis_admin` role — in practice the small maintainer team. No other account, and no anonymous visitor, can read them.
- **Abuse Prevention**: To limit abuse of the suggestion form, a salted SHA-256 hash of the sending IP address is kept only to rate-limit further submissions. It is used for at most one hour, and is deleted as soon as the next suggestion is submitted (submissions are infrequent, so in practice a hash can persist longer than an hour before that cleanup runs — it is simply never *used* past the one-hour window). The raw IP is never stored.

## Data Storage & Security
- **Local Storage**: Your sensitive academic data and credentials remain on your device.
- **Encryption**: Data stored locally is encrypted where supported by the browser.
- **No Third-Party Sales**: We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

## Third-Party Access

reIS contacts the following services. **IS Mendelu is the only one that receives your academic data**, and only because it is the university's own system. No other service on this list receives it, under any feature. The two that once did — Anthropic, for the Erasmus syllabus comparison, and Microsoft Bookings, for library study-room booking — were removed in September 2026 along with both features. jsDelivr receives no identifier, but the set of subjects requested does reveal which courses you are enrolled in.

**Always:**
1. **IS Mendelu** (`is.mendelu.cz`) — fetches your academic data, authenticated by you.
2. **Supabase** (`*.supabase.co`) — reIS's own backend: public notifications, society events and their attendance counts, anonymous usage events, and feedback you submit. Identified only by the random installation identifier described above.
3. **jsDelivr** (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`) — static subject-difficulty data. No identifier is sent, but the set of subjects requested does reveal to the CDN which courses you are enrolled in.
4. **OpenStreetMap** — campus map tiles.

**Only when you use the relevant feature:**
5. **Erasmus HEI directory** (`hei.api.uni-foundation.eu`) — a public list of partner universities. Nothing about you is sent.
6. **Photon** (`photon.komoot.io`) — venue search, used only by student-society administrators when creating an event.

**Links you open yourself** (Teams, Outlook, geteduroam, society websites) are handed to your browser or the relevant app. reIS makes no background request to them.

## User Control
You have full control over your data:
- **Access**: You can view all data displayed by the extension within its interface.
- **Deletion**: You can remove all locally stored data by uninstalling the extension or clearing the extension's storage in your browser settings.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
