import Foundation

/**
 * The on-disk shape of one PDF's ink: a binary property list of
 * `{version, pageCount, pages: [pageIndex: PKDrawing.dataRepresentation()],
 * insertedPages: [pageIndex]}`.
 *
 * Foundation only — no PencilKit, no UIKit — so it can be unit-tested and so the
 * format is readable without a canvas. `pageCount` is what the PDF had when the
 * ink was saved; the reader lays ink over the current PDF by page index and keeps
 * (but does not show) ink for pages that no longer exist.
 *
 * `insertedPages` are the blank pages the student added, as indices in the
 * document they were looking at — the PDF itself is never rewritten, so the
 * reader puts them back on every open (InkPages.apply). Version 2 files carry it;
 * version 1 files have no such key and read as an empty list.
 *
 * Version 3 also held `covers`, the blocks put over answers to practise
 * recalling them. That tool was withdrawn and the key is no longer read or
 * written. The version stays at 3 all the same: dropping back to 2 would make
 * every archive already on a device a "newer version", and `decode` quarantines
 * those — the ink would go with them.
 *
 * `pictures` (2026-10-03) are the photos the student put on pages, per page in
 * stacking order, as `PagePicture`s. The key is ADDITIVE and the version did not
 * move, for the same reason: a bump would make an older build quarantine the
 * whole file, ink included. The cost runs the other way and is smaller — an
 * older build (another worktree's, installed over this one) ignores the key,
 * drops the pictures on its next save, and deletes an archive whose only
 * content is pictures. Files without the key read as having none.
