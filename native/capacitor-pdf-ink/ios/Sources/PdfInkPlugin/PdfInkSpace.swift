/**
 * One subject's PDFs in a Notes-style space: Apple's split view with the file
 * list on the left and the reader on the right, the system sidebar toggle in the
 * reader's bar, a system Close on the list and an X in the reader's own bar —
 * two doors into the same `closeTapped()`. The space owns switching: a cached file loads
 * at once; anything else is requested from the app through `onNeedsFile` and
 * shown when `deliver` arrives. Closing persists first and reports every link
 * that was displayed.
 *
 * `currentLink` is the file the reader is actually showing — "" while it shows
 * a spinner or a message — and only becomes a link once that file has loaded,
 * so a pick that fails can simply be tapped again.
