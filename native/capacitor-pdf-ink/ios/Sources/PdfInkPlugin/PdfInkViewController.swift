/**
 * The reader. PDFKit renders and lays out the pages; PencilKit draws. Everything
 * the student touches is Apple's:
 *
 * - `PDFPageOverlayViewProvider` (iOS 16) puts one `PKCanvasView` over each page
 *   PDFKit is displaying. `usePageViewController(false)` + `isInMarkupMode` are
 *   what let touches reach the canvas instead of PDFView (Apple forum 716766).
 * - `drawingPolicy = .default` + `showsDrawingPolicyControls`: with a Pencil
 *   paired a finger scrolls and the picker's own "Draw with Finger" switch turns
 *   finger drawing on; without a Pencil a finger draws. No reIS toggle.
 * - Drawings, not canvases, are the source of truth: `drawings[pageIndex]`.
 *   PDFKit asks for overlays as pages scroll in and releases them as they scroll
 *   out, so a 200-page deck holds 200 small drawings and a handful of canvases.
 *
 * Saving is Notes-like: 1 s after the last stroke, before switching files, on
 * Close, and when the app resigns active. Empty ink deletes the file. The reader
 * shows one file at a time; `PdfInkSpace` decides which.
