/**
 * Configures MENDELU's eduroam as a Wi-Fi network from the student's own IS
 * certificate, through NEHotspotConfigurationManager. One tap in reIS, then
 * Join in iOS's own alert. The iOS half of android/.../EduroamPlugin.java.
 *
 * The recipe follows geteduroam's open-source iOS app (BSD-3), which does
 * EAP-TLS with private institutional roots through this same API:
 *
 * 1. SecPKCS12Import opens the .p12 with the extraction password IS shows.
 * 2. The identity, its chain and the MENDELU root go into the keychain access
 *    group `<TeamID>.com.apple.networkextensionsharing` — the header for
 *    setIdentity / setTrustedServerCertificates says the API resolves them from
 *    exactly that group at authentication time. NEVER request persistent
 *    references (kSecReturnPersistentRef): iOS then rejects the profile as
 *    invalid EAP settings.
 * 3. Old reIS items are deleted first, so re-running after the 366-day renewal
 *    replaces the credential instead of leaving two identities to pick from.
 *
 * Every failure names its stage, mirroring the Android plugin: "rejected" is
 * only actionable if we know whether the PKCS#12, the keychain, the settings or
 * the system alert rejected it.
 *
 * Trade-off, disclosed in the sheet: a configuration added this way is removed
 * when reIS is deleted (Apple DTS, forums thread 719422).
