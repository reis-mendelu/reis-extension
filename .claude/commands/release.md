# /release

Ships a release off `test`: version bump → release PR into `main` → merge tags
`vX.Y.Z` → **the iOS App Store build is cut from that tag**. The browser
extension is NOT part of this — see "Publishing the extension" at the bottom.

## Steps

1. **Preflight** — run these and abort if anything is wrong:
   - `git status` — clean working tree
   - on `test`, up to date with `personal/test`
   - no release PR into `main` already open (`gh pr list --base main`)
   - read the current version from `package.json`

2. **Ask the user** (AskUserQuestion, both in one message):
   - New version number (suggest the next patch increment)
   - One-line description for the commit

3. **Bump on a branch off `test`**:
   - `package.json` `version` and `wxt.config.ts` `manifest.version` — same value,
     or `release-tag.yml` refuses to tag
   - Commit `chore: bump to X.Y.Z - <description>`, PR into `test`, merge it

4. **Open the release PR** `test` → `main`. `release-checklist.yml` injects the
   checklist; `release-gate.yml` requires CI's *Build web preview* to have passed
   for that exact SHA. Walk the checklist — the device item is the one that
   actually catches things.

5. **Merge it.** `release-tag.yml` pushes `vX.Y.Z` and stops. Nothing is
   submitted to any store by any workflow.

6. **Cut the iOS build** on the Mac:
   ```bash
   git fetch --tags && git checkout vX.Y.Z && npm ci
   npm run release:ios -- --tag vX.Y.Z
   ```
   It picks a build number App Store Connect has not seen, syncs the web assets,
   archives, exports, verifies the .ipa (distribution-signed, right
   CFBundleVersion, no error telemetry) and uploads. It stops there.

7. **Submit by hand** in App Store Connect once processing finishes (~3 min):
   add the build to the version → Add for Review → Submit. Confirm the build
   picker really selected the new number; it lists stale builds first.
   `docs/ios-release.md` has the traps, `docs/app-store-listing.md` the listing.

## Rules
- Never skip the preflight — a dirty tree means uncommitted work ships as part of the release.
- Both `package.json` and `wxt.config.ts` move together.
- Merging without a version change releases nothing, on purpose. The bump is the release.
- Do not submit for review from a script. Upload is reversible; submission is not.

## Publishing the extension

`publish.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only and submits to Chrome, Firefox and
Edge. Run it deliberately, against a tag:

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

Review SLAs: Chrome 1–3 days, Edge 1–7 days, Firefox AMO days–weeks.
