# iPad PDF ink — design

**Status: approved for planning, 2026-09-06.**

## What this is

On an iPad, a subject PDF opened from the subject drawer opens in a native reader where
the student writes on the pages with Apple Pencil, the way Notes or GoodNotes work. The
ink stays on the device and is there again the next time the same file is opened. The
PDF itself is kept on the device too, so a file a student has opened once opens
instantly, without IS, and offline.

Everything the student touches is Apple's: `PDFView` shows the pages, `PKCanvasView` is
the drawing surface and `PKToolPicker` is the palette (pen, marker, eraser, lasso, ruler,
undo, redo). reIS writes no stroke rendering, no tool UI and no gesture code. The custom
code is glue: present a view, put one canvas on each page, read and write drawing data,
and decide which bytes to open.

### Why not the alternatives

Research on 2026-09-06 (sources at the end) ranked the options for a one-developer,
open-source, iPad-only feature:

- **pdf.js's own annotation editor** — react-pdf does not expose it, pdf.js maintainers
  call it viewer-internal, strokes have no pressure, and an open pdf.js issue (#20498)
  reports inking stopping after pinch-zoom on iOS with uncommitted strokes lost on blur.
- **Apple Markup via `QLPreviewController`** — the smallest build (about 150 lines), but
  a modal Apple sheet instead of a reIS screen, and it persists an edited PDF rather than
  strokes; rejected in favour of strokes over a fresh or cached original.
- **A web canvas overlay on the current pdf.js viewer** — WebKit permits one input type
  at a time and treats the Pencil as touch for scrolling, so "Pencil draws, finger
  scrolls" is fragile in a WKWebView; feel would be ours to build and mid-tier at best.
- **Nutrient / Apryse** — no Capacitor plugin (their Ionic and Cordova wrappers are
  deprecated), no free tier, quote-based annual pricing.

## Scope

In scope:

- iPad running iPadOS 16 or newer (the `PDFPageOverlayViewProvider` API is iOS 16).
  The app's deployment target stays 15.0; the plugin reports itself unavailable below 16.
- Subject files (lecture materials) opened from `SubjectDrawerSheet`.
- Freehand ink: pen, highlighter, eraser, lasso, undo and redo, all from `PKToolPicker`.
- Pencil draws, finger scrolls, with Apple's own "Draw with Finger" toggle: the canvases
  use `drawingPolicy = .default`, which follows the tool picker's finger-drawing switch
  when a Pencil is paired and lets a finger draw when none is. No reIS toggle.
- On-device persistence of the ink and of the PDF bytes.

Out of scope for v1, recorded so they are not rediscovered as gaps:

- Text boxes, shapes, sticky notes, text-snapping highlights.
- Exporting a flattened annotated PDF to Files. Feasible later with
  `PDFDocument.write(to:options:)` and `burnInAnnotationsOption`, after converting each
  `PKDrawing` into a stamp annotation.
- An ink badge in the file list.
- Sync between devices.
- The study documents (potvrzení, přehled), which stay one-tap sealed downloads.
- iPhone, Android, the desktop extension and the web preview. They keep the pdf.js viewer
  unchanged. The PDF cache module is platform-neutral TypeScript and could serve the
  iPhone viewer later; that is a separate decision.

## Architecture

```
SubjectDrawerSheet (phone tree; the iPad runs it)
  └─ usePdfPreview(courseCode)
       viewPdf(link, name, date)
         ├─ pdfInk.isAvailable()  ── false ─▶ fetch → blob URL → <PdfViewer> (as today)
         └─ true
              └─ pdfCache.resolve(key, date)
                   ├─ fresh copy      ─▶ PdfInk.open({ pdfPath, inkPath, title })
                   ├─ stale / missing ─▶ fetchIsBinary → write → index → PdfInk.open
                   └─ fetch failed, stale copy exists ─▶ PdfInk.open (stale-if-error)
              PdfInk.open rejects `unreadable` ─▶ blob URL from the same bytes → <PdfViewer>
```

Three units, each with one job:

| Unit | Where | Does | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PdfInk` plugin | `native/capacitor-pdf-ink` (Swift) | Presents the reader; owns reading and writing the ink file | PDFKit, PencilKit, Capacitor |
| `pdfInk` bridge | `src/mobile/pdfInk.ts` | Availability, key derivation, the open sequence with fallback signalling | `@capacitor/core`, `pdfCache` |
| `pdfCache` | `src/mobile/pdfCache.ts` (+ `pdfCacheIndex.ts` if it grows past 200 lines) | Where PDF bytes live, whether a copy is current, eviction | `@capacitor/filesystem` |

`usePdfPreview` orchestrates; it does not know about paths or files.

## Native plugin: `native/capacitor-pdf-ink`

Same shape as `native/capacitor-eduroam` and `native/capacitor-secure-store`: a Swift
package whose name `cap sync` derives from the npm name. The npm package is
`@reis/capacitor-pdf-ink` (a `file:` dependency in `package.json`), so the Swift package
and product are `ReisCapacitorPdfInk`, target `PdfInkPlugin` under
`ios/Sources/PdfInkPlugin`. `cap sync` scans for `@objc(...)` and generates the
registration; nothing is hand-wired into the Xcode project. Android gets no half of this
plugin; `registerPlugin('PdfInk')` on Android returns an object whose methods reject with
Capacitor's "not implemented", which the bridge treats as unavailable.

### API

```ts
interface PdfInkPlugin {
  /** True only on an iPad running iPadOS 16 or newer. */
  isAvailable(): Promise<{ available: boolean }>;
  /**
   * Presents the reader over the app and resolves when the student taps Done.
   * Rejects with code 'unreadable' if PDFKit cannot open the file at pdfPath.
   */
  open(o: {
    pdfPath: string;
    inkPath: string;
    title: string;
    /** Alert copy for a failed save, translated by the app: title, message, keep, discard. */
    strings: PdfInkStrings;
  }): Promise<{ hasInk: boolean }>;
}
```

`isAvailable` answers from `UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == .pad` and
`#available(iOS 16, *)`. TypeScript never guesses the device from the user agent or the
viewport (a WKWebView can call itself a Macintosh).

Paths are file URIs as returned by `Filesystem.getUri`. The ink file is read and written
by the native side only, so drawing data never crosses the bridge.

### View composition

- A `UINavigationController` wrapping `PdfInkViewController`, presented `.fullScreen`
  from the Capacitor bridge's view controller.
- `PDFView`: `displayMode = .singlePageContinuous`, `autoScales = true`,
  `usePageViewController = false`, `isInMarkupMode = true`. The last two are what let
  touches reach the overlay instead of being consumed by PDFView (Apple forum 716766).
- `PDFPageOverlayViewProvider` (iOS 16): returns one `PKCanvasView` per `PDFPage`,
  transparent (`backgroundColor = .clear`, `isOpaque = false`), sized to the page bounds
  and scaled by PDFKit with the page. PDFKit owns zoom, scroll and layout.
- Drawings, not canvases, are the source of truth: a `[Int: PKDrawing]` dictionary keyed
  by page index. The provider builds a canvas from the drawing when PDFKit asks for a
  page and releases it when PDFKit releases the page. A 200-page deck holds 200 small
  drawings, never 200 live canvases.
- `PKCanvasView.drawingPolicy = .default` on every canvas and
  `toolPicker.showsDrawingPolicyControls = true`: with a Pencil paired a finger scrolls and
  the picker's own "Draw with Finger" switch (a system-wide setting shared with Notes)
  turns finger drawing on; without a Pencil a finger draws. Palm rejection is Apple's.
  reIS ships no toggle of its own.
- One `PKToolPicker` instance observes every live canvas and is shown for the PDF view
  itself (a `PDFView` subclass that can be first responder), so the palette never
  disappears between pages. Undo and redo come from the picker and act on the window's
  undo manager, which every canvas reaches through the normal responder chain. The PDF
  view must NOT override `undoManager`: an override that asked the canvas back recursed
  until the stack overflowed (found on the first device run).
- Navigation bar: title (the file name) and a system Done button, which iOS localises.
  Nothing else.
- Appearance follows the system for the chrome; the paper does not. Every canvas has
  `overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .light` and the picker `colorUserInterfaceStyle = .light`,
  because PencilKit otherwise inverts ink for dark mode and the default pen drew white on a
  white page (found on the first device run). Ink data is unaffected; only rendering.
- The PDF view is pinned to the safe area, below the navigation bar, never under it.
  PDFView lays its pages out without honouring the automatic content inset a translucent
  bar adds, so UIKit's deceleration (toward the inset) and PDFView's layout (toward its own
  top) fought at the top edge and the page rested 37pt under the bar. Traced with an
  offset log on 2026-09-06; with no inset the rubber-band is monotonic.

### Persistence of ink

- File: `Library/pdf-ink/<key>.ink`. A binary property list encoding a `Codable`
  `InkArchive { version: Int, pageCount: Int, pages: [Int: Data] }`, where each `Data`
  is `PKDrawing.dataRepresentation()`. `version` is 1. Written with `.atomic`.
- `InkArchive` and its codec live in a UIKit-free file so they can be unit-tested with
  `swift test`.
- Save triggers, like Notes: `canvasViewDrawingDidChange` debounced 1 s; Done;
  `UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification`. If every page's drawing is empty the file
  is deleted, mirroring how an empty study note deletes its row.
- Load: on `open`, decode `inkPath` if it exists. Ink is laid over the PDF by page index.
  If the PDF now has fewer pages, ink for the missing indices stays in the archive and is
  not shown. If it has more pages, the new pages start empty.
- Corrupt or newer-than-known archive: rename it aside with a `.bad` suffix, start
  empty, log. Nothing is silently overwritten.
- Library is in the normal iOS device backup, as the downloads in Documents already are.
  Ink is irreplaceable, so that is wanted. Uninstalling the app removes it.

### Failure behaviour, native

- PDFKit cannot open the file: reject `unreadable` before presenting anything.
- A save fails (for example disk full): the next change retries. If the save triggered
  by Done fails, one `UIAlertController` says the ink could not be saved, with
  "Keep editing" and "Discard". The reader does not dismiss on "Keep editing".
- The app is killed while drawing: the 1 s debounce bounds the loss to the last second
  of strokes; the resign-active save covers backgrounding.

## PDF cache (`src/mobile/pdfCache.ts`)

Why: the ink then always sits on the exact bytes it was drawn on, opening is instant,
and annotated slides work offline or when IS is down.

- File: `LibraryNoCloud/pdf-ink/<key>.pdf`. No-cloud because the bytes are refetchable
  and a semester of slides should not bloat the device backup.
- Index: `LibraryNoCloud/pdf-ink/index.json`, one entry per key:
  `{ date: string, bytes: number, name: string, lastOpenedAt: number }`. `date` is the
  document date string IS shows in the file listing (`ParsedFile.date`), stored verbatim
  and compared by string equality. The index lives beside the files, not in IndexedDB,
  so a WebKit eviction can never orphan the PDFs. It is rewritten atomically after each
  change; a corrupt index is treated as empty and rebuilt from what the next opens
  write. The cap sweep lists the directory, so a `.pdf` with no index entry counts as
  least recently opened and is deleted first.
- `resolve(key, date)` returns `'fresh'` (entry exists, `entry.date === date`, file
  exists), `'stale'` (entry or file present but the date differs or the file is missing)
  or `'absent'`.
- Open policy in `openPdfWithInk`:
  1. `fresh` → open the cached copy. No network.
  2. `stale` or `absent` → `fetchIsBinary`. Binary → write, update the index, open.
     Not binary (IS served a viewer page) → the existing "cannot preview" fallback.
  3. Fetch threw and a copy exists (`stale`) → open the copy anyway (stale-if-error) and
     log. Fetch threw and nothing exists → the existing error path.
- After the reader closes, `lastOpenedAt` is updated and the cap is enforced: PDFs are
  evicted least-recently-opened first until the total is at or under **300 MB**. Ink
  files are never evicted. Deleting a PDF also deletes its index entry.
- The cache module takes its filesystem and clock as injected dependencies, so vitest
  drives it with an in-memory fake.

## Key

`key = sha256Hex(courseCode + ':' + fileLink)`, the same identity string the study notes
use (`getDocumentNoteKey`), hashed only because a URL is not a safe filename. Both the
ink file and the PDF file use it. `crypto.subtle` is already used in `src/utils/pkce.ts`.

## TypeScript integration

- `src/mobile/pdfInk.ts` (pattern: `src/mobile/eduroamNative.ts`):
  `registerPlugin<PdfInkPlugin>('PdfInk')`; `isPdfInkAvailable()` resolves once per
  session and is `false` anywhere but Capacitor on iOS; `openPdfWithInk(deps, input)`
  returns a discriminated result — `{ kind: 'shown' }`, `{ kind: 'unreadable', blob }`
  (caller falls back to the web viewer with the same bytes), `{ kind: 'notPdf' }`,
  `{ kind: 'failed', error }`. Dependencies (plugin, cache, fetch, token loader) are
  injected for tests, the same way `configureEduroam` takes `ConfigureEduroamDeps`.
- `useFileActions.openPdfInline` is split: `fetchPdfBlob(link): Promise<Blob | null>`
  does the platform-aware fetch that exists today; `openPdfInline` becomes
  `fetchPdfBlob` followed by `URL.createObjectURL`. Both the ink path and the web viewer
  consume the same fetched bytes, so a fallback never refetches.
- `usePdfPreview(courseCode)` gains the course argument (the sheet has it) and
  `viewPdf(link, name, date)` gains the document date. The branch order is: plugin
  available → `openPdfWithInk`; unavailable, or result `unreadable` → blob URL and
  `<PdfViewer>` exactly as now. The existing `isPreviewLoading` covers the fetch. While
  the native reader is presented the web UI is fully covered, so no new UI state exists.
- `FileList` / `FileListItem` pass `file.date` with the link on `onViewPdf`. That is the
  only list change.
- The desktop tree, iPhone, Android and the web preview do not change behaviour; the
  plugin is unavailable there and the code paths they take are the ones they take today.

## Privacy

reIS transmits nothing new. Ink and cached PDFs stay in the app sandbox. The
`noStudentDataLeaves` guard and `SUPABASE_CALLERS` are untouched. `PRIVACY.md` and
`docs/privacy-policy-app.md` need no new disclosure: this is local storage of the
student's own material, like the existing downloads and study notes.

## Testing

Test first, per the Iron Rules.

TypeScript (vitest):

- `pdfInk`: key derivation is stable and hex; availability is `false` in a browser, on
  Android, and on iOS when the plugin answers `false`; `openPdfWithInk` sequencing with
  fake deps — fresh copy opens without fetch; stale copy fetches once and rewrites;
  fetch failure with a stale copy opens the copy; `unreadable` returns the blob; the
  index is updated after close; the plugin's rejection codes map to result kinds.
- `pdfCache`: `resolve` for all three states; the index survives a corrupt file; the cap
  evicts least-recently-opened PDFs, never `.ink` files, and removes index entries with
  the files.
- `usePdfPreview` (extend `src/hooks/ui/__tests__/usePdfPreview.test.tsx`): plugin
  available → `open` called and no blob URL created; unavailable → blob URL as before;
  `unreadable` → blob URL from the same bytes with the fetch called once.
- `useFileActions`: `fetchPdfBlob` keeps the existing demo guard and the viewer-page
  `null`.

Swift:

- `InkArchive` round-trips through the codec; an unknown `version` decodes to a typed
  error. A `Tests/PdfInkPluginTests` target in the package, run with `swift test`. Neither
  existing plugin has tests; this adds the first, and the plan says how it is run.

Guards and CI: `check:app` is unaffected (the web build never reaches the plugin);
`noStudentDataLeaves` is unaffected.

Device checklist (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-ipad-pdf-ink-verification-checklist.md`,
same format as the eduroam one; written with the plan, run on the physical iPad):

1. Open a subject PDF, draw on pages 1 and 3, Done, reopen → strokes present on both.
2. Pencil-only policy: a finger scrolls and never draws; a palm resting does nothing.
3. Tool picker's "Draw with Finger" switch on: a finger draws; off: a finger scrolls.
4. Zoom to the maximum PDFView allows and inspect stroke edges for softness (known
   PDFKit report, Apple forum 792941). Record the result either way.
5. Rotate the iPad while a page is inked; strokes stay on their content.
6. Draw, wait 2 s, kill the app from the switcher, reopen → the stroke is there.
7. Draw, background the app mid-session, return → nothing lost.
8. Second open of the same file with Wi-Fi off → opens instantly from the cache.
9. Re-upload simulation: change the stored index `date` for the key, reopen online →
   a fetch happens and the copy is replaced.
10. Corrupt PDF (write junk to the cached path) → the web viewer fallback shows.
11. iPhone, and an iPad on iPadOS 15 if available → the web viewer as today.
12. A 100+ page deck scrolls smoothly with ink on a dozen pages.
13. Light and dark system appearance.
14. Erase everything on a file, Done → the `.ink` file is gone (checked via the
    console log the plugin prints on delete).

The iOS simulator can exercise finger drawing only (no Pencil is paired, so `.default` lets a finger draw); the Pencil policy and
palm rejection need the physical iPad. Screenshots from the device via pymobiledevice3.

## Release

Ships in the next iOS train via `/release`. Android and the desktop stores are not part
of the train and are not affected.

## Addendum 2026-09-06: the reader is a Notes-style space for one subject

Approved after the first device run. Research (in the plan's Task 10 notes): iOS 26 renders
every system Done button as a filled tinted circle with a checkmark; the HIG reserves Done
for "the task is complete"; Notes, Freeform, GoodNotes, Notability, Procreate and Files
markup all autosave and leave a document through a top-left control back to a collection.

### Composition (all Apple components)

- `UISplitViewController(style: .doubleColumn)`, presented full screen.
  `preferredDisplayMode = .secondaryOnly` — the space opens on the page alone and picking a
  file hides the sidebar again; Apple's toggle is the only way it appears (a student who tapped
  a file wants to read it). `preferredSplitBehavior = .tile`,
  `primaryBackgroundStyle = .sidebar`, `displayModeButtonVisibility = .automatic` (Apple's
  sidebar toggle appears in the reader's bar), `presentsWithGesture = true`.
- Primary column: `FileListViewController`, a `UICollectionView` list with the `.sidebar`
  appearance listing the subject's PDF files: name, IS document date, and a pencil glyph
  accessory when an ink archive exists for the file. Title is the subject name. Its left bar
  item is a system **Close** — iOS renders it as a glass X glyph; it is the HIG control for a
  presented space. There is no Done anywhere.
- Secondary column: the existing `PdfInkViewController`, now able to `load` another file:
  it persists the current ink, drops canvases and drawings, swaps the `PDFDocument`, loads
  the new archive and re-takes first responder so the tool picker stays visible.
- `PdfInkSpace` coordinates the two: selection → load (cached) or ask the app for the bytes
  (spinner over the reader until they arrive); Close → persist, alert on a failed save as
  before, otherwise dismiss and resolve `open` with the links that were shown.

### Plugin API v2

```ts
open(o: {
  courseTitle: string;
  currentLink: string;
  files: { link: string; name: string; date: string; pdfPath: string | null; inkPath: string }[];
  strings: PdfInkStrings; // + openFailed
}): Promise<{ shown: string[] }>;          // links displayed, for lastOpenedAt + the cap
deliverFile(o: { link: string; pdfPath: string }): Promise<void>;
fileUnavailable(o: { link: string }): Promise<void>;
// event 'needsFile' { link } — the app fetches + caches, then calls deliverFile
```

`pdfPath` is the cached copy's URI when the copy is fresh for the file's date, else null.
Native decides `hasInk` itself from `inkPath`. A file PDFKit cannot open shows
`strings.openFailed` in the reader and stays in the list; the initial file keeps today's
fallback to the web viewer.

### TypeScript

`openPdfWithInk` gains `courseTitle` and `files` (the subject's PDF attachments: link, name,
date) and `fetchPdf(link)`. It resolves the initial file as before, builds the payload from
one index read, subscribes to `needsFile`, answers each with the same fetch → store path and
`deliverFile` (or `fileUnavailable`), and on resolve records `lastOpenedAt` for every shown
link and enforces the cap. `usePdfPreview(courseCode, subject)` receives
`{ title, files }` from the sheet; `listSubjectPdfs(files)` flattens the drawer's
`ParsedFile[]` into that list.

## Addendum 2026-09-07: what the branch grew past the design

The design describes one reader over one file. Four features were added after it,
each on the same principle — Apple's control, no mode, nothing rewritten in the PDF:

- **Add and remove a page.** Blank pages are recorded in the archive
  (`insertedPages`) and re-applied on open; the PDF is never rewritten.
  `InkPages` owns the index shifting.
- **Page grid and find-in-document.** Both are sheets over the reader
  (`PageGridViewController`, `SearchViewController`); the tool picker hides while
  one is up because it floats in its own window.
- **Share with notes.** `InkExport` redraws each page and stamps the `PKDrawing`
  over it, so the text stays text.

## Addendum 2026-09-07: covering an answer — WITHDRAWN

A block over part of the page, so a lecture could be read back before the answer
was: drag one out with the cover tool on, tap it to look under, tap again to
shut it. Built (`CoverLayerView`, `PageCovers`, archive v3's `covers` key) and
then withdrawn the same day, on the author's call, to get this branch closed.
The reader's own Close in the bar went with it.

What is left of it, and why:

- **Archive version stays at 3.** Files carrying a `covers` key are on devices
  now. The key is no longer read or written, but dropping the version back to 2
  would make every one of those files a "newer version", which `InkArchive.decode`
  refuses and the store quarantines — the student's ink would go with the covers.
  `testAnArchiveCarryingCoversStillOpensWithItsInk` holds that line.
- **`PageOverlayView` stays**, and the reason is caution rather than a
  constraint. The canvas is alone under it again, so the wrapper looks pointless;
  `willEndDisplayingOverlayView` would identity-match bare canvases just as well,
  as it did before the wrapper existed. But the wrapper's job is to keep the
  canvas exactly the size of the page, and a `PKDrawing`'s coordinates are the
  canvas's coordinates — an inset of one point moves the ink in every archive on
  the device. Unwrapping touches that for no gain, so it does not get touched.
- **Leaving is either X.** The reader's own Close came back the same day, on
  2026-09-07, installed through `navigationItem.leadingItemGroups` — which UIKit
  adds BESIDE the split view's automatic toggle. The earlier "dead empty circle"
  was a toggle placed by hand, a different thing. Ours lands to the toggle's
  right; accepted. Spec: `2026-09-07-ipad-reader-exit-design.md`.

The whole design of the covers is in this file's history if it is ever wanted
back.

## Addendum 2026-09-07: the chrome carries the theme accent

Everything in the reader was system-coloured, so it read as an iPad app the student had opened
from inside reIS rather than as part of it. `open` now takes a `tint` and `PdfInkSpace.applyTint`
puts it on `split.view`, which is the whole space.

This is the one deliberate exception to "everything the student touches is Apple's", and it is a
narrow one — `tintColor` moves and nothing else. `PKToolPicker`, the share sheet and the context
menus have no styling API; the paper stays white because the canvases are forced `.light` and
PencilKit would invert the ink otherwise.

**Two hexes, not one.** `PdfInkTint.dynamic` builds a `UIColor(dynamicProvider:)` from the two in
`src/mobile/pdfInkTint.ts`. The dark bar gets the brand lime itself, #79be15, at 7.5:1 on it. The
light bar cannot have it — see below — so it gets the same hue darkened, #4a7a0d, at 5.2:1.

**The lime, but only where it can be seen.** reIS is green and the reader should read as green.
The constraint is the white bar, where #79be15 is 2.29:1 — the number `src/index.css` already
records, where the same finding moved `--color-primary-content` off white. A bar button the student
has to find and tap owes 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11) and the system blue it replaces clears ~4:1, so shipping
the lime there would have been a regression dressed as a brand. Darkening the same hue keeps the
brand and clears the floor.

Anything that does not parse means no tint at all: half a brand — one appearance ours, the other
Apple's — is worse than Apple's.

Two things worth knowing. Presented things are not inside `split.view` and inherit nothing, so the
sheets and both alerts are tinted by hand. And the page grid's current-page ring was drawing
`UIColor.tintColor.cgColor`, which resolves outside any view and always came out the system blue —
it now takes the cell's own tint and redraws on `tintColorDidChange`.

**Measured, not assumed.** The reader was hosted in a throwaway app on an iPad Air 11-inch
simulator (iPadOS 26.5) and screenshotted with and without the tint.

The first attempt tinted only `split.view` and changed almost nothing: the page grid's current page
moved and the bar did not. **On iPadOS 26 bar buttons are monochrome glass and ignore a tint
inherited from a parent view** — the whole bar region had no coloured pixel either way. A tint set
on the `UIBarButtonItem` itself does get through, so `applyTint` walks both navigation items and
the reader's sheets do the same for theirs. With that, every glyph in both bars is green: 1483
coloured pixels of #4a7a0d in light where there were none, and #79be15 in dark.

An earlier headless render had suggested the inherited tint alone reached the bars. It did not — a
headless render does not apply the glass bar styling, and only a hosted app on a real screen
settles a question about chrome.

## Addendum 2026-10-03: pictures on the page

A student can put a picture on any page — a photo of the whiteboard next to the
slide it explains, a diagram from their gallery — move it, resize it, delete it,
draw over it, and find it in the PDF they share. Free placement: anywhere on any
page, the teacher's or one they added. Interaction agreed with Dominik on
2026-10-03, including the two contested points below.

### What the student does

- **The `+` in the bar becomes a menu** in three sections with dividers — Add a
  page | Choose photo · Take photo | Edit pictures (cs: Přidat stránku | Vybrat
  fotku · Pořídit fotku | Upravit obrázky), Apple's own Notes verbs. The first
  build's flat list with "Z fotek / Přesunout obrázky" read as odd to Dominik
  (2026-10-03) and was regrouped. The bar stays at five buttons — it has only ever been cut down
  (see the covers) — and a blank page costs one tap more than it did. "Take
  photo" is absent when `UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(.camera)`
  is false (simulator, Mac); "Edit pictures" only when the file has a picture.
- **A new picture lands selected**, centred on the part of the current page that
  is on screen, at most half the page wide and half the page tall, aspect kept.
- **Arranging is a mode, and a visible one** — the precedent is the covers'. The
  pens go away, the bar's trailing items are replaced by one **Done**, and the
  canvases stop taking touches. The selected picture has an accent outline, four
  corner handles and a small **Delete** above it. Drag the body to move; drag a
  corner or pinch to resize, aspect locked. Tap another picture to select it.
  Tap empty page or Done to leave: the pens come back. A finger outside a
  picture still scrolls, because the picture layer's `hitTest` returns nothing
  there. Focus mode is unreachable while arranging — its button is not in the bar
  — so Done can never disappear with it.
- **While drawing, a picture is part of the page.** It sits UNDER the ink, so a
  photo of the board can be annotated, and nothing a pen or finger does in
  drawing mode moves it. Getting back to a picture is the menu's "Edit
  pictures", not a long-press: PencilKit owns the long-press on a canvas.
- **One undo stack.** Insert, move/resize (registered when the gesture ends) and
  delete register on the same undo manager PencilKit uses, so the palette's undo
  takes back the last thing done, stroke or picture. Adding or removing a page
  renumbers the pages under those registrations, so it clears the picture undo
  actions (`removeAllActions(withTarget:)`), exactly as it already strands no
  canvas. A file switch clears them too.

### Where it lives

- **Layer, not `PDFAnnotation`.** An annotation lives on the `PDFPage`, i.e. it
  rewrites the teacher's document, which this plugin never does, and
  `page.draw(with:to:)` in the export would render it implicitly. Instead
  `PageOverlayView` gets a `PictureLayerView` BELOW the canvas, laid out to
  `bounds` with no transform — the overlay's bounds are the page's points, the
  same space the drawing's coordinates are in. The canvas keeps its exact frame
  (the load-bearing rule above is unchanged).
- **The controller owns the data**, `pictures[pageIndex]`, the way it owns
  `drawings`; the layer only renders and reports gestures. The mode is applied in
  `overlayViewFor` too, so a page that scrolls in mid-arrange is not drawable.
- **#485's picker re-assert is kept, with two exceptions added**:
  `restoreToolPicker` returns early while arranging and while picking. Picking
  needs its own flag (found on the simulator): the menu closes before UIKit
  presents the photo picker, nothing is presented in between, and the re-assert
  put the pens back over the picker. Hiding also lets the responder go —
  `setVisible(false)` alone is not re-read while the page keeps it. The photo
  picker and the camera are dismissed in code, which
  `presentationControllerDidDismiss` never sees, so a cancel calls
  `showToolPicker()` itself (clearing the flag) and a pick enters arranging.
- **"Edit pictures" selects the top picture on the page on screen.** With
  nothing selected the mode looked like drawing but for the bar.
- **Geometry** is pure and in `PagePictures.swift` (tested without a view):
  initial frame, move and resize clamped to the page, a 24 pt minimum side, the
  topmost picture under a point. Handles are scaled by 1 / page scale so they
  stay finger-sized at any zoom.

### Stored with the ink

- **Archive key `pictures: [Int: [PagePicture]]`**, read with `decodeIfPresent`;
  a `PagePicture` is `{id, frame (page points, top-left origin, as displayed),
  jpeg}`. Array order is stacking order, newest on top. Points, not page
  fractions: ink drawn over a photo must stay over it if the page size changes.
- **The version stays at 3.** Bumping it would make an older build quarantine
  the whole file, ink included. The cost of not bumping is the other way round
  and smaller: an older build — including another worktree's build installed
  over this one on the same iPad — ignores the key, drops the pictures on its
  next save, and deletes an archive whose only content is pictures. Recorded in
  `InkArchive`'s header.
- **Pictures count as content**: `persistNow` deletes the archive only when
  ink, added pages AND pictures are all empty. `InkPages.shifted` moves them with
  added and removed pages; a removed added page takes its pictures with it, like
  its ink.
- **Ingest, once, at insert** (`PictureIngest`): ImageIO's thumbnail path with
  `kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform` (a camera photo is not sideways;
  a 12 MP photo is never decoded whole — about 48 MB on a 3 GB iPad), long edge
  at most 2048 px, JPEG quality 0.8 written by `CGImageDestination` with no
  metadata — so no GPS goes into a PDF the student then shares. The bytes are
  kept and never re-encoded; `persistNow` runs every second and must stay a
  plist write. A camera capture is never saved to the photo library (that would
  need another permission).
- **Known cost:** the archive is one file, so each save rewrites the pictures'
  bytes too — a few MB for a page of photos. Kept: one atomic file is what makes
  the archive impossible to half-write, and a sidecar per picture would need its
  own garbage collection.

### Export

`InkExport.flatten` draws page, then pictures, then ink — the order the reader
shows. Pictures are drawn from `CGImage(jpegDataProviderSource:)` so the PDF
context can embed the JPEG as-is rather than as a raw bitmap; the test measures
an export with photos so a regression to bitmaps shows up as size.

### Privacy and the other trees

- **Nothing leaves the iPad.** The photo picker is `PHPickerViewController`,
  which needs no photo-library permission. The camera needs
  `NSCameraUsageDescription`, which exists — but its text says the camera is used
  only for problem reports. That becomes false, so the plist string (both
  languages), the iOS line of `docs/privacy-policy-app.md` and
  `iosCameraUsage.test.ts` all gain the reader. The guard matters: its comment
  says to remove the key if the report picker goes, and doing that after this
  ships would terminate the app the first time a student taps Take photo.
  Apple's label does not change — data kept on the device is not "collected".
- **iPad only, pinned.** The reader is iPad-only (`isAvailable`), so the iPhone,
  Android and the extension have no ink to put a picture beside.
  `src/test/guards/inkPicturesAreIpadOnly.test.ts` records it.

### Testing

Swift (by hand, `ReisCapacitorPdfInk`): `PagePicturesTests` (geometry),
`PictureIngestTests` (downscale, EXIF orientation honoured, no GPS in the
output), `InkArchiveTests` (round trip; a v3 file without the key reads as no
pictures), `InkExportTests` (picture pixels under ink; JPEG passthrough size),
and reader tests: a picture survives persist + reload, a pictures-only archive
is not deleted, arranging disables canvases and keeps the picker away, an added
page shifts pictures, undo of a delete restores it. `ReaderScaleTests`' bar pin
is updated for the menu. Device: checklist step 27 on the cabled iPad with a
release build.

### Changed after Dominik's first device test (2026-10-03)

- **Over the ink by default, switchable.** "Under the ink" made it impossible to
  put a picture over notes, the more common wish. `PagePicture.aboveInk` (true
  for a new picture; a picture saved without the key reads as under). The
  overlay is now three views: `pictureLayer.belowInk`, the canvas, and
  `pictureLayer` (over-ink pictures + handles + gestures). The selected
  picture's chrome gains a second button beside 🗑 that flips the side, as one
  undoable change. A picture over the ink also wins a touch over one under it
  (`PagePictures.stackingOrder`). Export: page → under → ink → over.
- **Picking a placed picture up again: a finger tap.** With the Pencil drawing
  (`UIPencilInteraction.prefersPencilOnlyDrawing`, which PencilKit's
  `.default` policy follows) the finger does not draw, so a tap on a picture
  starts arranging with it selected. When the finger draws, a tap stays ink and
  `+` → Upravit obrázky is the way in. The recognizer only begins over a
  picture. "Long-press" was offered and not chosen: with finger drawing on it
  leaves a dot.
- **Pictures from Files** (`+Files`): Downloads is a second photo library for
  many students; the document picker, images only, out of process, no
  permission; the copy is ingested and deleted.
