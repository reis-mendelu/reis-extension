# REIS.mendelu

### A modern, student-built interface for the MENDELU Information System.

**REIS.mendelu is a browser extension that redesigns and streamlines the student experience at Mendel University. We transform the complex Information System into a fast, intuitive, and personalized dashboard so you can focus on your studies, not on searching for information.**

## The Problem

The MENDELU Information System is powerful, but it's also complex. For students, this often leads to:

-   **Information Overload:** Being presented with dozens of irrelevant links and options.
-   **Too Many Clicks:** Needing to navigate through multiple pages for simple, daily tasks.
-   **Fragmented Data:** Having to check the schedule, document server, and student portal separately to get a full picture.

## Our Solution

REIS.mendelu acts as an intelligent, client-side layer over the existing IS. It doesn't change anything on the university's servers; it simply reorganizes and presents the information in a smarter way, guided by three core principles:

1.  **The 3-Click Rule:** All daily-use, relevant information is accessible within **three clicks**.
2.  **Principle of Absolute Relevance:** We filter and prioritize information for you based on your specific semester, field of study, and faculty.
3.  **Data-Driven Design:** Our improvements are not based on guesses. We use quantitative data to measure and prove that our changes save you time.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Personalized Dashboard:** See your schedule for the day, newly uploaded files, and upcoming deadlines all in one place, right after you log in.
*   **Simplified Interface:** We intelligently hide unnecessary menus and clutter, giving you a clean and focused workspace.
*   **Intelligent Data Linking:** Click on a subject in your schedule and instantly see all related files, teachers, and exam dates without navigating to a different page.
*   **Community Integration:** We provide easy access to resources, events, and contacts relevant to your field of study, in collaboration with student societies.

## 🚀 Installation

The extension is currently in beta testing. A public release is planned for the Winter Semester of 2026/2027.

## 🗺️ Our Roadmap

We are developing the project in three distinct phases:

-   **Phase 1 (September/October 2025):** Development and internal testing of the core MVP (Dashboard & UI Simplification).
-   **Phase 2 (November 2025):** Open beta testing with a wider group of students to gather qualitative and quantitative feedback.
-   **Phase 3 (December 2025 / February 2026):** Final polish and public release on official browser stores.
-   **Future:** We are constantly exploring new ideas, including advanced personalization and machine learning applications.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

While we are not currently looking for new developers, the project's success depends on community feedback. As a student-led initiative, our primary goal is to be a bridge between the student body and the university.

-   **Give Feedback:** Have an idea or found a bug? Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/your-invite-link) and let us know!
-   **Spread the Word:** Tell your classmates about the project. The more users we have, the better data we get to make meaningful improvements.
