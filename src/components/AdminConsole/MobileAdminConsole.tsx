/**
 * A phone has no room for the desktop's side-by-side list and map, so they share
 * the screen behind a toggle — and the map has to be reachable on its own, not
 * only as a step inside the composer: rows fly the camera to their event, which
 * means nothing if the map can never be seen.
 *
 * Two rules make this work:
 *
 * 1. **The list is never unmounted.** EventComposer (hosted inside
 *    AdminEventList) keeps the entire form — title, date, time, venue, category
 *    — in local useState. Swapping it out for the map destroyed all of it, so
 *    tapping "pick on the map" wiped the form and handed back an empty one. It
 *    is hidden with CSS instead, which preserves every field.
 * 2. **The map is only mounted while visible.** Leaflet measures its container
 *    on init; mounting it inside a `hidden` element gives it a zero-size
 *    viewport and a map that never paints. Mounting on demand costs a re-init
 *    per toggle, which is cheap and, unlike the form, carries nothing worth
 *    keeping.
 *
 * `placingEvent` forces the map and hides the toggle: that flow has its own
 * instruction banner and Cancel, so a second way out would just be ambiguous.
