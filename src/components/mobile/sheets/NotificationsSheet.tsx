   * announced here and could not be opened: the tap did nothing at all.

   * The row's id is the map event's id (one `spolky_events` id space, mapped by

   * The link keeps priority where it exists: an author who set a URL chose a
   * destination, and the academic feed's rows are deadlines rather than places.

   * the public map filters out) does nothing rather than switching to a map with
   * nothing selected — and is not counted as a click, which is reserved for taps
   * that actually went somewhere.

  // switches to the map behind the browser the student was just handed. They
