/**
 * The drag has to survive the browser trying to take it.
 *
 * Reported as "the slidedown bugs all the time, it's not fluent; when I try to
 * pull it down it just disappears, then appears again weirdly" — one gesture,
 * two different outcomes, at random.
 *
 * The mechanism was already written down in this repo. `MapSheet` carries a
 * comment saying it was MEASURED on device: with the default `touch-action` the
 * browser claims the gesture as a pan partway through and fires
 * `pointercancel`, "measured on device for the other sheets, where a 350px
 * swipe was cut off after ~20px". `useMapSheetDrag` therefore attaches a
 * NON-PASSIVE touchmove and calls `preventDefault` while the sheet owns the
 * gesture. The generic `Sheet` — every other sheet in the app — never got any
 * of that, so:
 *
 *  - the browser steals the pan → `pointercancel` → `dragY` resets → the sheet
 *    snaps back under the finger ("appears again weirdly"), and
 *  - when the steal comes after the dismiss threshold instead, the sheet closes
 *    ("just disappears").
 *
 * Same gesture, different outcome depending on when the steal lands, which is
 * exactly what "bugs all the time" describes.
 *
 * Pointer capture is the second half: without it the events stop arriving the
 * moment the finger leaves the panel, so a long drag simply stalls.
