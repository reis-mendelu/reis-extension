/**
 * The one drag gesture behind every mobile sheet.
 *
 * There were two implementations of this and both were wrong in different
 * ways — `Sheet`'s inline handlers and `useMapSheetDrag` — which is how "the
 * slidedown bugs all the time, it's not fluent; when I try to pull it down it
 * just disappears, then appears again weirdly" came to be true of most of the
 * app while the map sheet felt fine.
 *
 * Four mechanisms, and a sheet needs all four:
 *
 * 1. **Ownership.** `dragOwnsGesture` refuses the gesture while any scroller
 *    under the finger is scrolled past its top, so reading a long list never
 *    costs the student their place.
 * 2. **The touch claim.** React attaches touch listeners PASSIVELY, so
 *    `preventDefault` from a React handler is a no-op and the browser is free
 *    to decide partway through that the gesture is a pan of its own and fire
 *    `pointercancel`. Measured on device: a 350px swipe cut off after ~20px.
 *    That is the reported bug — the steal lands before the dismiss threshold
 *    and the sheet snaps back, or after it and the sheet closes, from one
 *    gesture. Only a manual non-passive listener can hold the gesture.
 * 3. **Pointer capture.** Without it the events stop arriving the moment the
 *    finger leaves the panel: a long drag stalls, no `pointerup` ever lands,
 *    and `start` stays set so the NEXT touch continues the old drag. Taken on
 *    the first move PAST THE SLOP, never on the press — see `capture` below.
 * 4. **Click suppression.** A drag ends in a click on whatever was under the
 *    finger, which could cast an RSVP or follow a link as a side effect of
 *    closing. Swallowed once in the capture phase.
 *
 * What each sheet does with the travel is its own business — this reports it.

   * never showed it — iOS synthesises its click from the gesture recogniser,
