/**
 * The step back to today. The arrows and the day chips only ever step AWAY
 * from it, and nothing brought you back except stepping the same way.
 *
 * It floats above the tab bar, centred like the bar and dressed like it, and
 * exists only while the selected day is not today — so today's screen is
 * exactly what it was. It is NOT in the header: beside the date it never fit
 * on a phone (at 375 the title column is 187px and "Čtvrtek 10. září" plus
 * the pill need 228), under the date it made the calendar header one line
 * taller than the other tabs', and Dominik judged the header full at three
 * actions. Apple's Calendar keeps Today in the bottom bar for the same
 * reason. `bottom-[84px]` clears BottomNav (18px inset + its ~54px height +
 * a gap) and the pill is 44px, the hit-target floor every other control here
 * keeps; the scrollers under it pad `pb-36` so the last row is never under
 * the pill. Ink on the surface, not the lime: text-primary on a light surface
 * measured 1.89:1.
 *
 * `null` clears the choice and the screen falls back to `defaultIso`, which is
 * today for most of the year — so clearing is preferred, and the day then
 * re-derives itself at midnight instead of pinning a date. Before term the
 * default is the first teaching day, and clearing would land right back where
 * the pill is offering to leave; there it pins today's date explicitly. Without
 * that branch this is a control that visibly does nothing.
