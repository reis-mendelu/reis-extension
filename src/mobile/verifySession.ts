 * value (`isPlausibleToken`), so it short-circuited, login was never presented,
 * and the student landed on the first-run welcome screen — whose one-tap
 * eduroam card immediately 401s, because it is the first thing in the app to
 * actually talk to IS. Tapping through then produced "sign in?" AFTER the
 * failure, which is the order the student reported.
 *
 * So: ask IS once, before `ensureSession` gets to decide.
 *
 * **Only an authentication failure discards the token.** A timeout, an outage
 * or no signal must keep it — a student on a train would otherwise be pushed
 * into a login WebView that cannot load, losing a session that was still fine
 * and the cached data behind it. The two cases are distinguishable because the
 * transport tags exactly one of them (`err.sessionExpired`); everything else,
 * including an unknown error, keeps the token.
 *
 * Never throws. It runs before the React root exists, where a rejection is a
 * blank screen with a string on it.
