/**
 * happy-dom opens a 1024×768 window, which in this app's terms is a TABLET.
 *
 * That is the wrong default for the mobile tree. `useWideViewport` flips the
 * map's event panel from a bottom sheet to a right-hand rail at 768px, so
 * every phone-shell test silently began exercising the rail — no drag handle,
 * no peek row, no detents — and seventeen of them failed on markup that was
 * working exactly as designed at the width they were unknowingly asking for.
 *
 * A phone is the honest default here: the tests that mount `MobileApp` are
 * phone tests. A test that wants the tablet says so, by widening the viewport
 * itself.
