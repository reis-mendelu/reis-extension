/**
 * CI guard for reIS's central promise: student data never leaves the device.
 *
 * This is a REGRESSION FENCE, not a proof. It cannot understand data flow, so
 * it enforces three things a reviewer would otherwise have to notice by eye:
 *
 *  1. Only reviewed files may talk to Supabase at all.
 *  2. No student-identifying name may appear near a Supabase call.
 *  3. Hashing is not laundering. `SHA-256(studentId)` is NOT anonymisation —
 *     IS student ids are six or seven digits, so the entire preimage space is
 *     under ten million and a rainbow table reverses it in seconds. Digest
 *     calls are therefore allow-listed by file, so a new one has to be argued
 *     for rather than slipped in.
 *
 * When this fails, the fix is almost never to widen the list. It is to stop
 * sending the thing. Widening requires a reviewer to agree the payload carries
 * no student identity — write down why in the entry's comment.
