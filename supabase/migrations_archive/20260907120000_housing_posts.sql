-- Housing board: students hand rooms to students.
--
-- Identity travels only with an action the student took on purpose: the
-- poster's IS login and IS person id are attached after an explicit consent
-- tick, shown to every reIS user (any reader can verify the poster in IS).
-- The post stops being listed 14 days after publishing (expires_at > now()),
-- or immediately when the owner closes it. The row itself is deleted lazily,
-- by the sweep at the top of the NEXT call to submit_housing_post anywhere in
-- the database, once expires_at is more than a day in the past -- i.e. from
-- day 15 onward. On a quiet board with no submissions after that point, the
-- row can persist well past day 15; it is simply never listed. Nothing about
-- who READS the board is recorded. install_id is the same random per-install
-- UUID event_rsvps uses; it exists only so the device that published a post
-- can close it, and it is never returned by the list RPC.
