-- Týden's counter (spec 2026-10-30): how many installs open the phone/iPad
-- week view, to answer "people pick a view once and never switch" with data.
-- One more whitelisted label for the existing counter — the random install id
-- plus a fixed label, one row per install per day. Additive: the three labels
-- released builds send are still accepted, and the constraint only widens.
